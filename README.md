#### Complete Code Base for Bitcoin-Api

<br>

## Introduction:

This code repository, Bitcoin-Api-Full-Stack, is a JavaScript/NodeJS full stack Bitcoin API (see below for info about what APIs are), exchange, and casino (the exchange and the casino are still under construction). The term "full stack" in the title means that all the instructions and all the components are in this repository so you can build your own Bitcoin-Api system from scratch and you can build every aspect of it from computer server to phone webapp. This system lets people have their own versions of APIs, exchanges, and casinos instead of just having to use other companies', if they're okay with holding custody of their own Bitcoin. It's also designed in way so that even an individual can have control over these financial technologies instead of having to need a big team or a company.

**About APIs and Bitcoin APIs**

APIs allow developers to build technology that connects across the internet in a systematic way using URLs and internet requests from computers to those URLs. An example of this is sending a Tweet on Twitter from your phone, which is the computer in this case. Your phone makes an internet request to the Twitter API URL which is then responsible for creating Tweets.

What this Bitcoin API allows you to do is to easily send and receive Bitcoin using simple URLs. This lets developers program Bitcoin functionality into whatever technology they want, such as exchanges, wallet apps, IoT devices, or anything connected to the internet.

In this Bitcoin-Api system, the Bitcoin itself is stored on a Bitcoin node (Bitcoin node set up instructions provided) and the API connects to the Bitcoin node. Overall, your apps and your tech connect to the API and then the API connects to the Bitcoin node which is on your computer server.

The Bitcoin node and the API are considered to be the "backend" of the "stack" in the "full stack" concept. When implemented, the backend code and the associated data is on your computer servers and is not publicly accessible by users.

The "frontend" exchange and casino webapp set up instructions and code are provided. The webapp connects to your built Bitcoin-Api backend. The webapp code is a processed version of the frontend code which is sent to users' devices which implies the webapp code is publicly accessible. Frontend webapp users retrieve data that they're authorized to access, such as their Bitcoin balance data, from the backend.

It's important to note that even though all the code in this repository is publicly accessible, an implementation of this system is still secure because you still need the system's backend access keys to operate it.

The Bitcoin-Api system uses a large amount of cloud services provided by [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com). Bitcoin-Api is not sponsored by AWS although AWS is good because:
1. They have very high quality competitively priced cloud services
2. You have full responsibility for and ownership of your data üíØü§†

### About

The repo `bitcoin-api-full-stack` is a repo for anybody, even an individual,
to have their own Bitcoin management technology. Instead of needing an
entire group of individuals or a company to manage a Bitcoin wallet app,
exchange or casino, this repo aims to give the user complete individual control over
these powerful financial technologies.

### Bitcoin Node Servers

![https://bitcoin-api.s3.amazonaws.com/documents/open-source/bitcoin-api-full-stack/bitcoin-node-server-architecture-2.png](https://bitcoin-api.s3.amazonaws.com/documents/open-source/bitcoin-api-full-stack/bitcoin-node-server-architecture-2.png)

Briefly put: The NodeJS services interact with the Bitcoin node which in turn interacts with the Bitcoin blockchain. Overall, this means the NodeJS services gather data from the Bitcoin blockchain. The NodeJS services then perform the required actions on the Bitcoin-Api database. For example the fee data worker gets an estimate for the fee from the Bitcoin blockchain and updates the Bitcoin-Api database with that fee. That fee estimate can then be retrieved publicly using the `https://bitcoin-api.io/v3/fee-data` endpoint.

### How to Set Up the Backend


#### Requirements:

1. Have a Mac or Linux server, this can be a computer in your home, or in the cloud (e.g. an [EC2 instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/concepts.html)). The Linux server must meet [Bitcoin Core's computer requirements](https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-core/features/requirements).

2. Have access to that server. This means you should be able to access a command-line or terminal in that server using [ssh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell). You can also manually install the backend on a computer locally without ssh, that computer just needs to stay running and connected to the internet for the services to remain active.

3. Have a Redis service that you can access using a URL. [Redis Labs](https://redislabs.com) provides great Redis services.


### Set Up The Bitcoin Node Server(s)

The backend node server is responsible for updating the database. The backend node server has three main functions:

1. Update the fee data

2. Update the bitcoin deposit data, this includes user balance data

3. Perform bitcoin withdraws


> About multiple servers:
You can set up multiple backend servers if you have lots and lots of addresses although you only need one backend server, even if you have a few hundred thousand addresses. (This hasn't been tested yet although this is according to what [Andreas Antonopoulos](https://aantonop.com/) said. It should be taken into consideration that this claim was made in 2019 and that the tech is always improving.)


#### Steps to Setup a Bitcoin-Api Bitcoin Node Server

This section assumes you have the requirements listed above.


#### 1) Install and Start Bitcoin node

**About**

Install and start [Bitcoin Core](https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-core) on the server. This can take a while because the livenet blockchain takes a decent amount of time to transfer to your server through the internet because of its size which is currently over 250GB. The testnet blockchain downloads much faster because it's currently only around 25GB.


**Steps**

**a)** First, in the CLI of your Linux server, download the most recent Bitcoin Core code with the following command:
```
wget https://bitcoin.org/bin/bitcoin-core-0.20.0/bitcoin-0.20.0-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz
```
(you can check the [Official Bitcoin Core Download Page](https://bitcoin.org/en/download) to make sure this is the most recent Linux download link)

**b)** Extract the computer-usable code from the downloaded Bitcoin Core code:

```
tar xzf bitcoin-0.20.0-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz
```

**c)** Run this command to set up the Bitcoin Core Bitcoin node code on your Linux server:

```
sudo install -m 0755 -o root -g root -t /usr/local/bin bitcoin-0.20.0/bin/*
```

**d)** Start your Bitcoin node:

Start your bitcoin in staging mode (testnet):
```
bitcoind -testnet -daemon
```

OR

Start your bitcoin in production mode (livenet):
```
bitcoind -daemon
```

This should start up your Bitcoin node and trigger the blockchain to begin downloading onto your Linux server.

You can check to see that your Bitcoin node is running and how many blocks have currently been downloaded using the following command:

in staging
```
bitcoin-cli -testnet getblockcount
``` 
OR

in production
```
bitcoin-cli getblockcount
```

The resulting number of this bitcoin-cli command can be compared with the total number of blocks in the Bitcoin blockchain, also called the *block height*:

* [Blockchain.com Webpage with the Testnet Total Block Height](https://www.blockchain.com/btc-testnet/blocks)

* [Blockchain.com Webpage with the Livenet Total Block Height](https://www.blockchain.com/btc/blocks)

> Warning: if the getblockcount command stops working, it could mean your Bitcoin node crashed due to insufficient memory on your Linux computer.

> ‚ÄçFor reference: here's a list of commands you can use on your bitcoin node: [Chain Query list of commands for bitcoin-cli](https://chainquery.com/bitcoin-cli).

When your node has finished downloading and is up to date with the Bitcoin blockchain, the number returned from getblockcount will be equal to the actual blockchain block height. In the meantime, you can move forwards to the next steps.

#### 2) Install NodeJS and NPM

**About**

Next, NodeJS needs to be installed on your Linux server. NodeJS is used for the modules that interact with the Bitcoin node.

**Steps**

**a)** Install Git on your Linux server (Homebrew requires Git to be installed):
```
sudo apt install git
```
OR
```
sudo yum install git
```

**b)** Install and Configure Homebrew

First run:
```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"
```

Then run:
```
sudo apt-get install build-essential
```
OR
```
sudo yum groupinstall 'Development Tools'
```

Then run:
```
echo 'eval $(/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/brew shellenv)' >> /home/<PUT COMPUTER USER NAME HERE (e.g. ec2-user)>/.bash_profile
eval $(/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/brew shellenv)
```

Homebrew also recommends running these commands:
```
brew install gcc
export LDFLAGS="-L/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/opt/isl@0.18/lib"
export CPPFLAGS="-I/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/opt/isl@0.18/include"
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/opt/isl@0.18/lib/pkgconfig"
```

**c)** Install NodeJS and NPM with Homebrew

Run the following commands:
```
brew install node@12
echo 'export PATH="/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/opt/node@12/bin:$PATH"' >> /home/<PUT COMPUTER USER NAME HERE (e.g. ec2-user)>/.bash_profile
export LDFLAGS="-L/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/opt/node@12/lib"
export CPPFLAGS="-I/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/opt/node@12/include"
```

Try typing in `node` in your CLI and see if your CLI turns into a NodeJS REPL interface. If not, try reconnecting to your Linux server. It's possible that will trigger NodeJS to be activated.

**d)** Install pm2 Globally

To install [pm2](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/) globally, run the following `npm` command:
```
npm install pm2@latest -g
```

Next, install [pm2-logrotate](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pm2-logrotate) with the following `pm2` command:
```
pm2 install pm2-logrotate
```

#### 3) Install and Start MongoDB

**About**

MongoDB is used locally on your Bitcoin-Api Bitcoin node server for caching. It prevents unnecessary non local server database writes to the main cloud database when updating addresses and balances.

These instructions will go through setting up MongoDB on an Amazon Linux server. If your machine is not an Amazon Linux, you can find the appropriate instructions here in the [official MongoDB Linux installation instructions](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/install-on-linux/).

**Steps**

**a)** Set Up Linux Server for MongoDB

Add the following as a file at this location, `/etc/yum.repos.d/mongodb-org-4.2.repo`, on your Linux server:
```
[mongodb-org-4.2]
name=MongoDB Repository
baseurl=https://repo.mongodb.org/yum/amazon/2/mongodb-org/4.2/x86_64/
gpgcheck=1
enabled=1
gpgkey=https://www.mongodb.org/static/pgp/server-4.2.asc
```
> This file can be added using the `touch` and `nano` CLI commands. You may need to use `sudo` in front of those commands for admin access.

**b)** Install and Start `mongod` MongoDB Base Process

Install MongoDB with this CLI command:
```
sudo yum install -y mongodb-org
```

Start the `mongod` base process:
```
sudo systemctl start mongod
```

You can verify that the `mongod` base processes has started successfully with: 
```
sudo systemctl status mongod
```


#### 4) Set Up Bitcoin-Api Bitcoin Node Backend

**About**

This section deals with set up for deployment to a remote Linux server. The deployment method used is called Giraffe Lick Leaf (GLL). The way GLL deployment works is you input a deploy command on your home computer that specifies a NodeJS service for the Bitcoin node. The deploy command triggers your home computer to send the most recent code for the specified NodeJS service to the remote Linux server. The Linux server accepts and installs the NodeJS service if it doesn't already exist, or it updates the existing service. 

This section goes through how to set up the Bitcoin-Api Bitcoin node backend for deployment. The main task is to transfer the Tree Deployüå≤üå≥ code to the Linux server. The tree deploy code runs on your Linux server and it accepts and install the incoming code sent from your home computer.


**Steps**

**a)** Set Up Files and Folders

Set up the appropriate files and folders using the following CLI commands:
```
touch currentWithdrawReports.txt
mkdir tigerScript
mkdir treeDeploy
mkdir treeDeploy/giraffeDeploy
```

and in staging:
```
mkdir treeDeploy/stagingCredentials
mkdir treeDeploy/stagingCredentials/tree
```
OR

in production:
```
mkdir treeDeploy/productionCredentials
mkdir treeDeploy/productionCredentials/tree
```

**b)** Set Up AWS Resources

This section goes over the AWS resources that are needed to operate the backend.

##### Backend IAM Policies

Here's the [AWS IAM Policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html) that are needed for Bitcoin-Api's backend. The naming for the staging IAM policies is the same except for `_staging` is appended to the policy name.

[AWS IAM Policy Management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#/policies)

* [`bitcoin_api_user_calzoneSun`](https://github.com/bitcoin-api/bitcoin-api-full-stack/blob/master/infrastructure/policies/aws/bitcoin_api_user_calzoneSun.json)

* [`bitcoin_api_user_feeFee`](https://github.com/bitcoin-api/bitcoin-api-full-stack/blob/master/infrastructure/policies/aws/bitcoin_api_user_feeFee.json)

* [`bitcoin_api_user_korg`](https://github.com/bitcoin-api/bitcoin-api-full-stack/blob/master/infrastructure/policies/aws/bitcoin_api_user_korg.json)

* [`bitcoin_api_user_theomega`](https://github.com/bitcoin-api/bitcoin-api-full-stack/blob/master/infrastructure/policies/aws/bitcoin_api_user_theomega.json)

* [`bitcoin_api_eFunction_addTransactionAndUpdateExchangeUser`](https://github.com/bitcoin-api/bitcoin-api-full-stack/blob/master/infrastructure/policies/aws/bitcoin_api_eFunction_addTransactionAndUpdateExchangeUser.json)


##### Backend IAM Users

Next, the [AWS IAM Users](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users.html) for Bitcoin-Api's backend need to be set up. The naming for the staging IAM users is the same except for `_staging` is appended to the user name.

[AWS IAM User Management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#/users)

**Calzone Sun User**

user name: `bitcoin_api_calzoneSun`

policies: `bitcoin_api_user_calzoneSun`


**Fee Fee User**

user name: `bitcoin_api_feeFee`

policies: `bitcoin_api_user_feeFee`


**Korg User**

user name: `bitcoin_api_korg`

policies: `bitcoin_api_user_korg`, `bitcoin_api_eFunction_addTransactionAndUpdateExchangeUser`


**TheOmega User**

user name: `bitcoin_api_theomega`

policies: `bitcoin_api_user_theomega`, `bitcoin_api_eFunction_addTransactionAndUpdateExchangeUser`


##### Backend DynamoDB Tables

This section describes the required [AWS DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb) production tables for Bitcoin-Api. The staging tables are the same except for `_staging` is appended on the table name.

[AWS DynamoDB Management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/home)

| Table Name | Partition Key (type) | Sort Key (type ) | 
|--|--|--|
| bitcoin_api_addresses | userId (string) | address (string) | 
| bitcoin_api_auxiliaryEmailCases | email (string) | caseId (string) |
| bitcoin_api_balances | userId (string) | - | 
| bitcoin_api_exchangeUsers | userId (string) | - | 
| bitcoin_api_loginTokens | exchangeUserId (string) | expiryTime (number) | 
| bitcoin_api_metadata | key (string) | - |
| bitcoin_api_transactions | exchangeUserId (string) | transactionId (string) |
| bitcoin_api_users | userId (string) | - |
| bitcoin_api_withdraws | userId (string) | ultraKey (number) |


##### Backend DynamoDB Secondary Indexes

| Table Name | Index Name | Partition Key (type) | Sort Key (type ) |
|--|--|--|--|
| bitcoin_api_addresses | address-index | address (string) | - |
| bitcoin_api_exchangeUsers | email-index | email (string) | - |
| bitcoin_api_transactions | exchangeUserId-creationDate-index | exchangeUserId (string) | creationDate (number) |
| bitcoin_api_withdraws | state-creationDate-index | state (string) | creationDate (number) |


##### Backend S3 Storage Bucket

This section goes over how to set up the required [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3) production bucket for Bitcoin-Api. The staging bucket is the same except for `_staging` is appended onto the bucket name (recommended for simplicity, although it's not necessary and the S3 staging bucket can have a completely different name if wanted).

[AWS S3 Management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/home)

**Steps to Set Up Bitcoin-Api S3 Bucket (Staging or Production)**

1. Create a bucket in S3

2. Create a folder on the root level of that bucket and call it `qr_codes`. This is the folder where the Bitcoin address QR code images are stored.


**c)** Set Up Backend .env Environment Variable Files

The following environment files need to be created and set up:


**Calzone Sun**

.env path: `/1-backend/<stagingCredentials OR productionCredentials>/calzoneSun/.env`

.env Template: [Calzone Sun .env Template File](https://github.com/bitcoin-api/bitcoin-api-full-stack/blob/master/infrastructure/environment/dotenv-templates/1-backend/calzoneSun.env)


**Fee Fee**

.env path: `/1-backend/<stagingCredentials OR productionCredentials>/FeeFee/.env`

.env Template: [Fee Fee .env Template File](https://github.com/bitcoin-api/bitcoin-api-full-stack/blob/master/infrastructure/environment/dotenv-templates/1-backend/feeFee.env)


**Giraffe**

.env path: `/1-backend/<stagingCredentials OR productionCredentials>/giraffe/.env`

.env Template: [Giraffe .env Template File](https://github.com/bitcoin-api/bitcoin-api-full-stack/blob/master/infrastructure/environment/dotenv-templates/1-backend/giraffe.env)


**Korg**

.env path: `/1-backend/<stagingCredentials OR productionCredentials>/korg/.env`

.env Template: [Korg .env Template File](https://github.com/bitcoin-api/bitcoin-api-full-stack/blob/master/infrastructure/environment/dotenv-templates/1-backend/korg.env)


**The Omega**

.env path: `/1-backend/<stagingCredentials OR productionCredentials>/theomega/.env`

.env Template: [The Omega .env Template File](https://github.com/bitcoin-api/bitcoin-api-full-stack/blob/master/infrastructure/environment/dotenv-templates/1-backend/theomega.env)


**Tree**

.env path: `/1-backend/<stagingCredentials OR productionCredentials>/tree/.env`

.env Template: [Tree .env Template File](https://github.com/bitcoin-api/bitcoin-api-full-stack/blob/master/infrastructure/environment/dotenv-templates/1-backend/tree.env)


**d)** Send and Start Initial NodeJS Services Modules

For this step, you will manually send and start up the NodeJS service modules (a.k.a. "The Tigers"). This is only necessary for the initial setup and after this the Giraffe Lick Leaf (GLL) deployment can be used for instant deploys with a single simple command.

For this command you will need to create a `/infrastructure/scripts/1-backend/setUpTigers.sh` pre-gitignored set up command file using the provided [`/infrastructure/scripts/1-backend/setUpTigers.template.sh` template file](https://github.com/bitcoin-api/bitcoin-api-full-stack/blob/master/infrastructure/scripts/1-backend/setUpTigers.template.sh).

A chart is provided showing how to replace the template placeholder values in detail:


#### Set Up Tigers Configuration Chart

| value to update  | meaning | example |
|--|--|--|
| mode | environment | either staging or production |
| pemPath | path on your home computer to your Linux server's .pem access key file | /Users/user-name/user-files/super-secret-path/linux-server-access-file.pem |
| sourceRepoPath | the path on your home computer to where your `bitcoin-api-full-stack` repo is located (this repo!üòé) | /Users/user-name/my-code-folder/bitcoin-api-full-stack |
| destinationUserName | the user name you use to access your Linux server | ec2-user |
| destinationUrl | the URL of your Linux server | ec2-instance-name.ec2-instance-region.compute.amazonaws.com |
| destinationHomePath | the home path on your Linux server for your Linux user | /home/ec2-user |

After the values have been replaced, run the `/infrastructure/scripts/1-backend/setUpTigers.sh` command to transport the NodeJS service modules from your home computer to your Linux server.

In the `/infrastructure/scripts/1-backend` folder in your CLI, run:

```
./setUpTigers.sh
```
> note: you may need to run `chmod 777 ./setUpTigers.sh` first before running the set up script

After the modules have been transported to your Linux server, it's time to start them up!


#### Here's the instructions to manually run your NodeJS services:

**Calzone Sun (manually triggered)**

This NodeJS service adds unused addresses to the system. Run the following commands in the `/[Linux user home path]/tigerScript/calzoneSun` path on your Linux server:

If not already, install the Calzone Sun node modules with:
```
npm install
```

Then, to add new addresses to your Bitcoin-Api system, you can run the following command:
```
node AddUnusedAddress [number of addresses to add, defaults to 1]
```

or in production:
```
node AddUnusedAddress.js [number of addresses to add, defaults to 1] --mode=production
```

Adding an address to your Bitcoin-Api system will look like this:
![Calzone Sun Creating New Bitcoin Address](https://bitcoin-api.s3.amazonaws.com/images/documentation/calzone-sun-successfully-added-address.png)

<br>

**Fee Fee (runs in infinite loop)**

This NodeJS service updates your Bitcoin-Api system's fee data which includes the fee itself in terms of how much the user pays on Bitcoin withdraw. This service is managed by pm2. To set up the NodeJS fee data service, in the `/[Linux user home path]/tigerScript/feeFee` path on your Linux server, first install the node modules:

```
npm install
```

Then, run the following command to start up the NodeJS fee data service:
```
pm2 start UpdateFeeDataWorker.js
```

or in production:
```
pm2 start UpdateFeeDataWorker.js -- --mode=production
```

You can also test the service without pm2 using:
```
node UpdateFeeDataWorker
```

or:
```
node UpdateFeeDataWorker --mode=production
```

After the main function finishes, it starts again after 10 seconds to keep the fee up to date in your Bitcoin-Api system.

When the main function has finished, it should look like this:

<img
    src="https://bitcoin-api.s3.amazonaws.com/images/documentation/fee-fee-successful-execution.png"
    width="800"
/>

To watch your service's logs, first use this pm2 command:
```
pm2 list
```

and see which is the number associated with the `UpdateFeeDataWorker.js` process, in this case. Running this command also provides other useful data associated with your pm2 processes.

Next, to view the fee data worker logs in realtime, run:
```
pm2 logs [the number of your NodeJS service's process]
```
You can optionally sign up and log in to pm2's web services and see your NodeJS service's logs in your browser, in realtime, using the [pm2 webapp](https://app.pm2.io/).

This pm2 command can also be used to monitor your fee data service and all your other pm2 services:
```
pm2 monit
```

> **Important Note:** In the file `/1-backend/feeFee/updateFee.js`, you can adjust the fee levels using the `getFeeData` function. As a result of the fast seamless Giraffe Lick Leaf deployments, it's possible to do fast changes of what the fee is!! At the backend level... wow!!!üò≤ü§†üßêüëÅ

> **Errors:** If the service stops working or if you see any errors, particularly as soon as you first run the service, it could be possible there's a misconfiguration. It's also possible there could be a network, a blockchain, or a cloud service provider error. The logs will provide details about the cause of any error that occurs.

This updates the [AWS DynamoDB](https://console.aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/home) `bitcoin_api_metadata_staging` or `bitcoin_api_metadata` table with the new fee data. The key associated with the fee data in the metadata table is `fee`. The actual fee the user pays is calculated as follow:
```
Values stored in the DynamoDB database entry:
amount,
multiplier,
blessing fee,
trinity fee,
sacrament fee

Calculation:

base fee = (amount x multiplier)
holy fee = (blessing fee + trinity fee + sacrament fee)

fee to pay = (base fee + holy fee)
```

Please consider contributing a portion of the fee you collect towards the environment, thank you very much!üå≤üå≥üåÑüòá

<br>


**The Omega (runs in infinite loop)**

This NodeJS service updates Bitcoin addresses and user balances for Bitcoin deposits to Bitcoin-Api addresses. To set up this pm2 managed NodeJS Bitcoin deposit worker service, in the `/[Linux user home path]/tigerScript/theomega` path on your Linux server, first install the node modules:

```
npm install
```

To run the Bitcoin deposit worker, input the following command:
```
pm2 start UpdateDepositData.js
```

or in production:
```
pm2 start UpdateDepositData.js -- --mode=production
```

You can also test the service without pm2 using:
```
node UpdateDepositData
```

or:
```
node UpdateDepositData --mode=production
```

A successful iteration of the Bitcoin deposit worker should look like this:

![Update Deposit Data Worker Successful Execution](https://bitcoin-api.s3.amazonaws.com/images/documentation/theomega-successful-execution.png)


<br>


**Korg (runs in infinite loop)**

This NodeJS service performs Bitcoin withdraws. To set up this pm2 managed NodeJS withdraw Bitcoin worker service, in the `/[Linux user home path]/tigerScript/korg` path on your Linux server, first install the node modules:

```
npm install
```

To run the withdraw Bitcoin worker, input the following command:
```
pm2 start WithdrawMoneyDoer.js
```

or in production:
```
pm2 start WithdrawMoneyDoer.js -- --mode=production
```

You can also test the service without pm2 using:
```
node WithdrawMoneyDoer
```

or:
```
node WithdrawMoneyDoer --mode=production
```

When an iteration of the withdraw Bitcoin worker completes, it should look like this:

![Withdraw Money Doer Successful Execution](https://bitcoin-api.s3.amazonaws.com/images/documentation/korg-successful-execution.png)

<br>

**e)** Transfer Tree Deployüå≤üå≥ Code

This step explains how to set up the tree deploy code.

To transfer the tree deploy code first you must create a `/infrastructure/scripts/1-backend/plantTree.sh` file (pre-gitignored). A template file is provided at [`/infrastructure/scripts/1-backend/plantTree.template.sh`](https://github.com/bitcoin-api/bitcoin-api-full-stack/blob/master/infrastructure/scripts/1-backend/plantTree.template.sh).

Refer to the [Set Up Tigers Configuration Chart](#set-up-tigers-configuration-chart) for details on how to configure the required values which are the same for `plantTree.sh`.

After you've set up your `plantTree.sh` file, transfer your tree deploy files to your Linux server by running the following command in the `/infrastructure/scripts/1-backend` folder:
```
./plantTree.sh
```
> note: you may need to run `chmod 777 ./plantTree.sh` first before running the plant tree script

Now, in your Linux server, go to the `/[Linux user home path]/treeDeploy/giraffeDeploy/tree` folder and install the node modules for your tree deployment code with:
```
npm install
```

You can test that the transfer and set up of your tree deploy code went successfully by running the following command:
```
node WaterTree
```

or in production:
```
node WaterTree --mode=production
```

It will look like this:
![Water Tree No-Op](https://bitcoin-api.s3.amazonaws.com/images/documentation/water-tree-no-op.png)


And that's it, your Bitcoin-Api backend Bitcoin node server is now operational and is also ready for ultra-fast Giraffe Lick Leaf deployments! See more on this in the next step.

### How to Deploy Backend

Now that we've got our Bitcoin-Api backend Bitcoin node server up and running, let's go over how to do a super fast Giraffe Lick Leaf (GLL) deployment to instantly update your backend NodeJS services!

First, in your Linux server at `/[Linux user home path]/treeDeploy/giraffeDeploy/tree`, run:
```
node WaterTree
```

or in production:
```
node WaterTree --mode=production
```

This command will start up your tree code acceptor and installer. 


Now, on your home computer in one of the `/infrastructure/scripts/1-backend/giraffeLickLeaf/feeFee`, `/infrastructure/scripts/1-backend/giraffeLickLeaf/korg`, or `/infrastructure/scripts/1-backend/giraffeLickLeaf/theomega` folders in this repo, run one of the following commands to do an instant deployment of a NodeJS service:

##### Deploy Backend NodeJS Service with GLL

```
./deployStaging.sh
```

or in production:
```
./deployProduction.sh
```

This will trigger a GLL deployment to update your NodeJS service, here's an example demo video of what the deployment looks like:

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZ4zdq4AJY8">
    <img
        src="https://bitcoin-api.s3.amazonaws.com/documents/open-source/bitcoin-api-full-stack/youtube-logo-2.png"
        width="85"
    />
</a>

GLL deployment provides continuous integration for the backend NodeJS services that interact with the Bitcoin node on the Linux server. The overall Bitcoin-Api service doesn't need to be shut down or be interrupted.

After you've finished your deployments, you can shut down your Water Tree code acceptor and installer process in your Linux server. To do this simply input the keyboard keys `control` plus `c`.



### How to Deploy API

The API is serverless, it uses [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda) functions which are accessed through [API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway). This section goes over how to set the API up.


**a)** Set Up Environment Variables

Use the [API Environment Variable Template File](https://github.com/bitcoin-api/bitcoin-api-full-stack/blob/master/infrastructure/environment/dotenv-templates/2-api/api.env), create an environment variable file and add it to `/2-api/credentials/beautifulRiver3/staging/.env` in staging, and add it to `/2-api/credentials/beautifulRiver3/production/.env` in production.


**b)** Set Up AWS API Resources

This section goes over the [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com) resources that necessary to set up and run the Bitcoin-Api API.


##### API IAM Policies

Here's the [AWS IAM Policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html) that are needed for Bitcoin-Api's API. The naming for the staging IAM policies is the same except for `_staging` is appended to the policy name.

##### API IAM Roles

The following [AWS IAM Roles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles.html) need to be created and set up. The naming for the staging IAM roles is the same except for `_staging` is appended to the policy name.

##### API IAM Users

To deploy the API, the following [AWS IAM User](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users.html) needs to be created and set up. The naming for the staging IAM user is the same except for `_staging` is appended to the user name.

[AWS IAM User Management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#/users)

**Deploy API User**

user name: `bitcoin_api_deployApi`

policies: `bitcoin_api_user_deployApiFunctions`, `bitcoin_api_user_deployExchangeFunctions`


#### Deploy API

To deploy the [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda) functions required for the Bitcoin-Api API, in the `/infrastructure/scripts/2-api` path in this repo, run the following script:
```
./deployStaging --meta="sa"
```
or in production:

```
./deployProduction --meta="sa"
```

For reference here are the API deploy command options:

| command name  | meaning | possible values |
|--|--|--|
| functions |  filter functions by nickname, function names separated by commas  | any Lambda function nickname (e.g. `POST/tokens,GET/tokens`) |
| meta | API(a) or exchange(e) | `a`, `e`, or `ae` (deploy all functions, defaults to `ae`)  |

This will set up the Lambda functions associated with the core API part of your Bitcoin-Api. Next, the set up for the [AWS API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway) API used as your core API will be explained in detail. How this works is you create an HTTP API with API Gateway and you attach your deployed Lambda functions to the HTTP API Gateway. After you set up the core API, you will be able to set up the exchange API.

#### API Gateway Set Up 

First go to the [AWS API Gateway Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/main/apis) and press "Create API".

For the "Choose an API type" section, choose "Build" for the "HTTP API" type API.

You will next be prompted to input a name for your API. Input the following API name `bitcoin_api_core_api_staging` or `bitcoin_api_core_api` and press "Next".

Next, you will be prompted to "Configure routes". Press "Next".

You will then be prompted to "Review and create". Pres "Create".

Next, create six Lambda integrations, and attach them to the appropriate routes:

* `bitcoin_api_api_tokens_post_staging`

* `bitcoin_api_api_tokens_get_staging`

* `bitcoin_api_api_tokens_put_staging`

* `bitcoin_api_api_addresses_post_staging`

* `bitcoin_api_api_feeData_get_staging`

* `bitcoin_api_api_withdraws_post_staging`


**CORS Settings Configuration:**

| Setting |  Value |
|--|--|
| Access-Control-Allow-Origin | * |
| Access-Control-Allow-Headers | * |
| Access-Control-Allow-Methods | * |
| Access-Control-Expose-Headers | * |
| Access-Control-Max-Age | 0 Seconds |

Next, now your core Bitcoin-Api API is almost active, only a couple more steps.

First, add the following database entry to the `bitcoin_api_metadata` or the `bitcoin_api_metadata_staging` DynamoDB table:
```.json
{
  "key": "onAndOffSwitch",
  "bitcoinApiIsOn": true,
  "bitcoinApiIsOffReason": "This Bitcoin-Api instance is off because I'm out having fun with my lover!!!üåπüíïüíòÔ∏èüíñüíèüíñüíòÔ∏èüíïüåπ"
}
```
You can use this database object to control whether the whole API is on or off. Simply set 
`bitcoinApiIsOn` to `false` to turn the API off.

Now, add the following Lambda function to [run periodically using CloudWatch](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/home?region=us-east-1#rules):

* `bitcoin_api_lambda_service_cacheOnAndOffStatus` - every one minute

And now, your Bitcoin-Api core API is active!


#### Deploy The Exchange API

(üößüë∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüë∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüèó the code for this section still needs to be updated)

To finish the rest of the set up which includes setting up the exchange, there's a few more steps.

**Set Up Exchange Bitcoin-Api Token**

Create a token using the `POST - /tokens` endpoint on your newly created API. The token and the userId associated with this token both need to be added for your API environment variables `EXCHANGE_BITCOIN_API_TESTNET_TOKEN` and `EXCHANGE_TOKEN_USER_ID`. 

**Deploy Exchange API Lambda Functions**

Deploy your Bitcoin-Api exchange API functions with the following command in the `/infrastructure/scripts/2-api` path in this repo:

```
./deployStaging --meta="e"
```
or in production:
```
./deployProduction --meta="e"
```

**Set Up AWS SES**

Set up your [AWS SES](https://aws.amazon.com/ses/) email. SES is used to send emails for setting up exchange accounts.

First, verify the email that you're going to be using to send the exchange emails from, this can be your exchange's support email. You can also verify the entire domain of the email that you're sending from. Verifying your email can be done on [this page in the AWS SES browser console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ses/home#verified-senders-domain:).

Next, create an [AWS SNS](https://aws.amazon.com/sns) topic to forward email events to an AWS Lambda function. Call this topic `bitcoin_api_auxiliaryEmailCaseEventForwarder_staging` or `bitcoin_api_auxiliaryEmailCaseEventForwarder`. On creation, give it a nickname `s_ba_email` or `p_ba_email` (this is optional, you can give it another nickname if you wantüòÉü§†). You can create and configure your SNS topics in the [AWS SNS browser console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/sns/v3/home#/dashboard).

For the SNS topic you've just created, attach your `bitcoin_api_eService_handleAuxiliaryEmailCase_staging` or  `bitcoin_api_eService_handleAuxiliaryEmailCase` Lambda function as a subscriber.

Now, back in your [AWS SES browser console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ses/home), go to your email's or your domain's settings.  In the settings, go to the notifications section and click "Edit configuration". In the "SNS Topic Configuration" settings, for `Bounces`, `Complaints`, and `Deliveries` choose `bitcoin_api_auxiliaryEmailCaseEventForwarder_staging` or `bitcoin_api_auxiliaryEmailCaseEventForwarder`. Leave the "Include original headers" checkbox unchecked. Press "Save Config" after.

In your API's .env file, your `EXCHANGE_MANAGEMENT_EMAIL` environment variable must be set to your verified SES's email used to send emails for your exchange.

**Set Up API Gateway HTTP API**

For the Bitcoin-Api exchange API, just repeat creating an HTTP API in the same way you created the `bitcoin_api_core_api` API except using the exchange Lambda functions. You can name it `bitcoin_api_exchange_api_staging` or `bitcoin_api_exchange_api`.

And there go!! Your very own Bitcoin-Api API, exchange, and casino!!!üòÉü§†üßêüòéüëÅüéâüéäü•≥

### How to Deploy Frontend

The frontend code modules are [React](https://reactjs.org) webapps made with [Create React App](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html). They can be deployed in the same way as any other React webapp. The deployment tool currently used for the webapp in the [exchange and casino video demo](https://youtu.be/EMAwIrHM2Qc) is [AWS Amplify](https://aws.amazon.com/amplify) using its monorepo functionality.
