### About

The repo `bitcoin-api-full-stack` is a repo for anybody, even an individual,
to have their own Bitcoin management technology. Instead of needing an
entire group of individuals or a company to manage a Bitcoin wallet app,
exchange or casino, this repo aims to give the user complete individual control over
these powerful financial technologies.

## More...

This has just begun, the repo needs to be cleaned up a bit. The point will be to make this fast and easy to deploy overall. There is much work to be done, PRs and colaborative efforts welcome.👏

Please note that the deployments are currently very fast once set up.
