### About

The repo `bitcoin-api-full-stack` is a repo for anybody, even an individual,
to have their own Bitcoin management technology. Instead of needing an
entire group of individuals or a company to manage a Bitcoin wallet app,
exchange or casino, this repo aims to give the user complete individual control over
these powerful financial technologies.
