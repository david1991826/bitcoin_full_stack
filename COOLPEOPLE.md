#### Why are Amazon Web Services (AWS) used in the foundation of Bitcoin-Api's tech?

The Bitcoin-Api system's foundation uses several cloud services provided by [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com). AWS is used in the foundation of Bitcoin-Api's tech for the following reasons:
1. In using AWS, you have full ownership of your data. For this Bitcoin-Api system, your [private keys](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Private_key), which grant you direct access to your Bitcoin when connected to the Bitcoin network generally, are included within your system's data which you have full ownership of.üíØü§† (your private keys are automatically managed by Bitcoin Core within your Bitcoin node Linux server, you can access your private keys manually if necessary)
2. AWS has excellent quality and competitively priced cloud services. üñ•üìä
3. AWS has very high security standards which means very high security for your cryptocurrencies and other data. üõ°üíÇüèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
